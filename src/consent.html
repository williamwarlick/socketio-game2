    <p>We are asking you to participate in a research study titled “Assistance games”. This study is being led by Abhilasha Kumar, Psychology at Bowdoin College.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how humans seek and provide help in cooperative scenarios.</p>
        
        <p>If you agree to participate, we will ask you to take part in an online computer-based 
            experiment, where you will play a game with another participant. 
            You will be presented different goals on the screen and asked to take actions 
            that help you achieve those goals, in cooperation with your partner. 
            You will also complete a demographic survey. 
            You will also be provided a debriefing script at the end of the experiment for 
            educational purposes. The entire experiment will be completed in one session that 
            will not exceed 60 minutes.</p>
