<p>Here are the rules of the collaborative game for both you 
and the Helper:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>You as an Architect will be given a set of goals, which will be unknown 
to the Helper.</li>
<li>Remember, this is a collaborative game. Do whatever it takes to help 
each other.</li>
<li>You can only move one block on a turn.</li>
<li>Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks or on the floor.</li>
<li>You will play 10 rounds of the game and each round will have a different 
secret goal.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Goals can be of many forms. You may be asked to move a specific type of 
block (e.g., red) to a specific room (e.g., A). You may be asked to clear or 
fill up a particular room (e.g., A1 or B2). You may also be asked to cover or 
uncover a particular type of block (e.g., red). Covering a block means making 
sure there is another block on top of it. Uncovering a block means making sure 
there is no other block on top of it.</p>
